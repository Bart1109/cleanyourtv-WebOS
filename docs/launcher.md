# The launcher

The launcher replaces LG's Home. It is a web page of the project that the TV's browser runs, so it starts fast and works the
same on every supported webOS version.

![Home screen](screenshots/home.jpg)

## The screen

- **Dock.** Up to four apps, large, on the first row.
- **Top shelf.** The name of the focused app and an ambient glow taken from its icon.
- **Grid.** All other apps, sorted by how often you use each one (or A to Z).
- **Top buttons.** Inputs, Live TV, Settings and Customise, and a clock. The buttons you see are yours to change.
- **Open apps.** Optionally a green dot on the tile of every app that is open, as on the active input in the Inputs list: off by
  default, **Customise** > **Mark running apps** switches it on, in the launcher and in the Inputs picker. Back on the home screen lists
  the open apps to close them (see [Running apps](#running-apps)).

## Keys

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Open an app | OK |
| App options (dock, hide) | Hold OK on an app |
| Move or remove a top button | Hold OK on it |
| Customise | The **Customise** button |
| Live TV | The **Live TV** button or tile |
| Switch input | The **Inputs** button |
| Put an input on Home | Hold OK on it in the Inputs list |
| Close running apps | Back on the home screen |

The Magic Remote pointer works too: pointing and clicking, and holding the button on an app for its options.

## Running apps

Back on the home screen lists the apps that are open, as LG's Home does with its Recents on a second Back. OK closes an app,
**Close all** closes every app in the list, and Back leaves it. Closing an app also removes it from LG's recent apps.

It lists the apps the launcher knows, including the ones you hid from the grid; Home itself, CleanYourTV's own apps and the TV's
system apps are never in it. The list is read when it opens and closes when you leave Home. Suggested and first built by
[Steefzar](https://github.com/lasharor/cleanyourtv-WebOS/issues/16).

## Customise

![Customise menu](screenshots/customise.jpg)

**Customise** holds how Home looks:

- the **dock**: each app in it can be replaced (an app already in the dock swaps places), moved or removed, and **Add an app...**
  fills a free place. Holding OK on an app gives **Add to dock**, **Move left**, **Move right**, **Remove from dock** and **Hide app**;
- the **top buttons**: move one left or right, remove it, or add Inputs, Settings, Live TV or any app;
- **hidden apps** (show them again);
- the **app order** (most used first, or A to Z);
- **mark running apps** (a green dot on their tiles, or none);
- the **clock** format (automatic, 12 or 24 hour);
- the **theme** (see [Themes](themes.md)) and the **accent colour**; the theme list shows each theme's screenshot;
- **Wallpapers**: your own photos behind Home, and how often they change (see [Wallpapers](wallpapers.md));
- **More settings...**, which opens the [manager app](manager.md) for everything the TV and the service do.

Putting the dock, buttons, hidden apps, order and clock back to the defaults is in the manager app: **Reset Home customisation**.


## Cards

Themes with places for cards (for now **Lock Screen**) have a **Cards** row in **Customise**. It lists the places (above the clock,
beside the clock, a column on the right, above the dock); choose one to put a card there or leave it empty. A card you chose stays
when you switch to another theme with the same place.

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Greeting | Good morning, afternoon or evening, with your name if you set one, and the date on a second line where there is room. |
| Text | Your own text. `{{greeting}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{date}}` and `{{weekday}}` are filled in and kept up to date; `**bold**`, `*italic*` and a line starting with `#` for a heading. In three sizes. |

Names, texts and the other options are typed on your phone: **Customise** > **Cards** > **Set up from your phone** opens the manager
app with a QR code. The page shows a form for each place, and **Edit as JSON** shows all cards at once, for example
`{"greeting": {"type": "greeting", "name": "Sam"}}`. It stays open while you use it, at most an hour, and needs the code shown on
the TV. Weather and Home Assistant cards are coming. How a theme marks its places is in [Themes](themes.md#slots-for-cards).

## Inputs

The **Inputs** button lists HDMI inputs by the names LG shows, with what is connected and a marker on the active one. OK
switches to the input.

### An input on Home

Hold OK on an input in the Inputs list and choose **Add to Home**. The input then shows as a tile, with the HDMI symbol, the name
the TV gives it (for example the name of the connected console) and its port. It is a tile like an app: OK switches to the input,
and holding OK on it offers **Add to dock**, **Move left**, **Move right** and **Remove from dock**. **Remove from Home** takes it
off again; that is also in the Inputs list. A tile of an input with nothing connected is dimmed and still switches to it.

In the [Inputs picker](input-key.md) of the Input key, holding OK on an HDMI input does the same: it is added to Home, or taken off
when it already is. An input in the dock also shows in the picker's row of dock apps.

## Icons

Each tile uses the app's own icon. The tile colour is taken from the icon's edge colour, so an icon that reaches its edges blends
into the tile, and the ambient glow comes from the icon's most vivid colour. Colours are worked out once per app and remembered.

An icon that is an opaque square with a transparent margin around it (many LG icons) is enlarged so it fills its tile, and a
gradient icon in the dock gets a tile with the same gradient ([#3](https://github.com/lasharor/cleanyourtv-WebOS/issues/3)).

## Language

Menus follow the TV's language, or the one chosen in the manager app: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Turkish and
Arabic. See [Languages](languages.md), also for adding one.

## Themes

The look of the home screen (colours, tile and text size, columns, clock, glow, animation speed, wallpaper) is a [theme](themes.md),
chosen in the manager app.

## Settings file

Settings are stored on the TV in `/media/developer/cleanyourtv/config.json`:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `dock` | App ids in the dock (up to four). |
| `topbar` | The buttons at the top. |
| `hidden` | App ids you hid. |
| `pinnedInputs` | The inputs on Home: `{id, label, port}`, `id` being the input's app (for example `com.webos.app.hdmi2`). |
| `sort` | `usage` or `alpha`. |
| `clock` | `auto`, `12` or `24`. |
| `runDots` | `true` shows a green dot on open apps (off by default). |

See [`config.example.json`](https://github.com/lasharor/cleanyourtv-WebOS/blob/main/config.example.json). Change settings in
the launcher; the file is read and written by the service.
